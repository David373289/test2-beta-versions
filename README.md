Welcome to the beta versions of Test2. Here, there are experimental features for the next update being tested. Just be careful since there might be a lot of bugs in this version. Currently, Test2 1.7 is under development and the release date of it is currently unknown. Also, sometimes I might just lose interest in developing this website, so there can be month-long times with no updates.

# Note: The number of beta versions for 1.7 are currently unknown, so they might change.
